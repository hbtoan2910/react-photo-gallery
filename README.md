## Pending issues:

- The preloading feature performs best on Firefox, but doesn't work as effectively on other browsers like Chrome or Opera, even after implementing caching to enhance rendering speed.

**1. Firefox performance**: Display a progressive render faster

**2. Chrome performance**: More aggressive about image quality, sometimes at the cost of initial render speed
